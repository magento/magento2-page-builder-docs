# Override Page Builder styles

To override the internal CSS Page Builder applies to content types, you must create a CSS selector with a [specificity](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Specificity) greater than 110, which is Page Builder's default selector specificity for all native and custom content types. To learn the details of how Page Builder styles its content types, see [How Page Builder styles content](how-pagebuilder-styles-content.md).

To help you with overriding Page Builder styles, we recommend the following CSS selector pattern. This pattern ensures your CSS will override Page Builder's existing CSS selectors for content types.

## CSS selector override pattern

1. `#html-body` - Start all your override selectors with this `id`. It's in the `<body>` element of all Magento frontend and admin pages.

1. `[data-content-type="content-type-name"]` - Add a content-type attribute selector next, where the `"content-type-name"` is the name of the content type found in its configuration file. For example, to target the `Row` content type, your attribute selector would look like `[data-content-type="row"]`.

1. `Any additional selector` - The first two selectors match Page Builder's internal selectors with a specificity of 110. Adding any other selector (except `*`) will bump the specificity to 111 or higher, which overrides Page Builder's internal selector.

## CSS selector override example

For example, if you wanted to override the CSS that Page Builder applies to the `Heading` content type, you could use a selector pattern that targets one of the `Heading` HTML elements (like `h1`),which would create a CSS specificity of 111, as shown here:

```scss
#html-body h1[data-content-type="heading"] {}
```

With one additional HTML element selector, you can override Page Builder's default style while keeping the specificity low for additional overrides, as needed.

## More selector override examples

In the following examples, each selector targets a different HTML element of a content type, but all of them have a specificity higher than Page Builder's default of 110:

**Override all `Heading` styles**

```scss
#html-body [data-content-type="heading"][data-element="main"]  {} // Specificity 120
```

**Override all `Heading` styles for `default` appearance**

```scss
#html-body [data-content-type="heading"][data-appearance="default"] {} // Specificity 120
```

**Override all `Row` inner element styles**

```scss
#html-body [data-content-type="row"] [data-element="inner"] {} // Specificity 120
```

**Override all `Text` typography styles**

```scss
#html-body [data-content-type="text"] p {} // Specificity 111
```

## Override content using CSS Classes

So far, we've only used IDs, attributes, and elements to override Page Builder's CSS. But you can also use CSS classes to fill the `any additional selector` slot of the pattern. To override a content type using one or more custom CSS classes:

1. Create the CSS selector.

2. Apply the CSS class.

### Step 1: Create the CSS selector

If your CSS class name is `.theme-headings`, the CSS selector you define in your `.less` file would look something like this:

```scss
#html-body [data-content-type="heading"].theme-headings {}
```

![Page Builder style selector](../images/pagebuilder-style-override-selector.svg)

By adding the class to the pattern, you create a `Heading` selector with a specificity of 120â€”which again overrides Page Builder's default specificity of 110. All the CSS rules declared in this class selector will override Page Builder's equivalent rules for the `Heading` content type.

### Step 2: Apply the CSS class

The second step is to add your custom class name to the content type's form editor, specifically to the **CSS Classes** field.

For example, to have Page Builder apply the `theme-headings` class to a `Heading` on the page, you would open the `Heading` form editor and enter `theme-headings` (no period) in the **CSS Classes** field, as shown here:

![Add CSS class to content type](../images/css-classes-field.svg)

Page Builder adds this class to the `Heading` element (`h1` - `h6`) in the DOM, where it is targeted and styled by your CSS class selector and ruleset.
