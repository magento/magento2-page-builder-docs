# How to add viewports

By default, Page Builder defines four viewports, but only two are shown on the Admin stage: `desktop` and `mobile`. The other two viewports (hidden from the stage), are `tablet` and `small-mobile`. This topic shows you how to add the hidden viewports to the stage.

**Example Code**. A fully functioning example for adding additional viewports is available for you to view and install here: [https://github.com/magento-devdocs/pagebuilder-viewports/tree/how-to-add-viewports](https://github.com/magento-devdocs/pagebuilder-viewports/tree/how-to-add-viewports). This example is implemented as an Admin theme for Page Builder, an approach we recommend for all viewport changes.
