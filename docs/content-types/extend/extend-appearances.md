## Extend an appearance

In this topic, you will learn how to add a new user-defined property to an existing content type. Specifically, we will add a `max-height` property to all the Banner appearances. Why? Because our customers [told us to, drill sargeant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6VPEcj77v8).

**Scenario:** Your customers use Banners to feature products on their site. However, they don't like the fact that the Banner's height grows with the content they enter. So they want you to add a `max-height` field to all the Banner appearances. That way they can limit all their banners to the same height, and have their extra content scroll as needed.

## Steps to extend appearances

These steps describe the basic process for adding new style properties to an existing content type:

1. [Create a Page Builder extension module](#step-1-create-a-page-builder-extension-module).
1. [Add your properties to elements](#step-2-add-new-properties-to-elements).
1. [Add your property fields to the form](#step-3-add-your-property-fields-to-the-form).
1. [Add admin and frontend styles](#step-4-add-admin-and-frontend-css) (as needed).

### Step 1: Create a Page Builder extension module

Use the [PB Modules CLI](https://github.com/magento-devdocs/pbmodules) to create the starting directory structure and files for a Banner extension. Instructions for using PB Modules can be found in the repo [`README.md`](https://github.com/magento-devdocs/pbmodules#pb-modules) file.

Navigate to your `<magento-instance-root>/app/code/` directory and run the following command:

```terminal
npx https://github.com/magento-devdocs/pbmodules.git
```

Extend the `Banner` and complete the remaining prompts. When finished, you should have a complete directory structure and all the files you need (plus extras) to start extending the Banner.

Before continuing, run `bin/magento setup:upgrade` to install and enable your module.

### Step 2: Add new properties to elements

Now we can add our `max-height` property to the right `element` in all the Banner appearances. But which `element`?

We know that the Banner's content is making the Banner grow. So we need to find the `element` node that controls text. And here it is:

```xml
<element name="content">
    <html name="message" preview_converter="Magento_PageBuilder/js/converter/html/directive"/>
</element>
```

The use of an `html` node confirms it. We didn't mention the `<html>` node earlier, but it allows the value for a field to be output as HTML. We can confirm this as the right element by looking at the `preview.html` and `master.html` templates for the HTML elements that are bound to the `content` element:

```html
<!-- master.html -->
<div attr="data.content.attributes"
     ko-style="data.content.style"
     css="data.content.css"
     html="data.content.html">
</div>

<!-- preview.html -->
<div if="isWysiwygSupported()"
     class="inline-wysiwyg"
     ko-style="data.content.style"
     css="data.content.css"
     attr="data.content.attributes"
     afterRender="afterRenderWysiwyg"
     contenteditable="true"
     event="mousedown: stopEvent, click: activateEditor, dblclick: handleDoubleClick">
</div>
```

Both templates have `<div>` elements with several attributes bound to `<element name="content">`, including the `html` attribute on the frontend template (`master.html`). We can safely say that this is right element for our `max-height` property.

Because `max-height` is an official CSS property, we will add it using the `style` node as follows:

```xml
<element name="content">
    <style name="max_height" source="max_height" converter="Magento_PageBuilder/js/converter/style/remove-px"/>
</element>
```

Attributes of the `style` node are described briefly here:

-  `style name` — name used to bind to the form field with the same name.
-  `style source` — name of the CSS property in snake_case. Page Builder changes `max_height` to `max-height` when writing it to the DOM.
-  `converter` — JavaScript function that converts internal property values to and from the DOM because DOM values are often not in the right format for internal processing.

To add the `max-width` property to the `content` element of each appearance,

1. Open your module's `banner.xml` file.
1. Remove the `preview` and `master` templates as well as the `main` element nodes from each appearance.
1. Add your new `content` element and `style` node to the `elements` node of each appearance.

When you are done, the `appearances` section of your `banner.xml` file should look like this:

```xml
<appearances>
    <appearance name="collage-left">
        <elements>
            <element name="content">
                <style name="max_height" source="max_height" converter="Magento_PageBuilder/js/converter/style/remove-px"/>
            </element>
        </elements>
    </appearance>
    <appearance name="collage-centered">
        <elements>
            <element name="content">
                <style name="max_height" source="max_height" converter="Magento_PageBuilder/js/converter/style/remove-px"/>
            </element>
        </elements>
    </appearance>
    <appearance name="collage-right">
        <elements>
            <element name="content">
                <style name="max_height" source="max_height" converter="Magento_PageBuilder/js/converter/style/remove-px"/>
            </element>
        </elements>
    </appearance>
    <appearance name="poster">
        <elements>
            <element name="content">
                <style name="max_height" source="max_height" converter="Magento_PageBuilder/js/converter/style/remove-px"/>
            </element>
        </elements>
    </appearance>
</appearances>
```

### Step 3: Add your property fields to the form

Before you add a field to the form of an existing content type, you need to decide where to add it. In other words, you need to pick a fieldset for your field. For our `max_height` field, it makes sense to add it below the Banner's existing `min_height` field, which is in the the `appearance_fieldset`.

In our example, we used the following markup for our `max_height` field:

```xml
<form xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="urn:magento:module:Magento_Ui:etc/ui_configuration.xsd">
    <!-- Full Form: Magento/PageBuilder/view/adminhtml/ui_component/pagebuilder_banner_form.xml -->
    <fieldset name="appearance_fieldset">
        <field name="max_height" sortOrder="30" formElement="input">
            <argument name="data" xsi:type="array">
                <item name="config" xsi:type="array">
                    <item name="default" xsi:type="number">400</item>
                </item>
            </argument>
            <settings>
                <label translate="true">Maximum Height</label>
                <additionalClasses>
                    <class name="admin__field-small">true</class>
                </additionalClasses>
                <addAfter translate="true">px</addAfter>
                <dataType>text</dataType>
                <dataScope>max_height</dataScope>
                <validation>
                    <rule name="validate-number" xsi:type="boolean">true</rule>
                </validation>
            </settings>
        </field>
    </fieldset>
</form>
```

Explaining UI component form fields is beyond the scope of this topic, but a few brief descriptions of the most important nodes might help those of you who are not familiar with UI components. If you already know about UI components, feel free to skip this part.

| Elements            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `fieldset`          | The fieldset `name` should match the name of the fieldset from the Banner's form. The `appearance_fieldset` is common to all the content type forms and, by default, appears at the top of the forms using the `sortOrder` of 10. If you used [PB Modules](https://github.com/magento-devdocs/pbmodules/), the `fieldset` node names were copied from the Banner's form, so you're all set.                                                            |
| `field`             | The field `name` should match your `style` node name in your `banner.xml` config file. The same is true if you are adding `attribute`, `css`, `html`, or `tag` nodes; their names should match the field names that supply their values. Fields also have a `sortOrder` you can use to place your field above or below existing fields. The `formElement` for a field describes the HTML form type, such as input, wysiwyg, select, checkbox and more. |
| `argument > config` | Provides the initial configuration for the field, including the `default` value. We set our default `max_height` field to `400` (px).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `settings`          | Provides the field with a label, CSS styling, validation, and other properties as needed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

### Step 4: Add admin and frontend CSS

For this extension to work as expected, we need to apply a CSS `overflow: scroll` property to the `content` element in the DOM.

Open your module's Admin and frontend `_default.less` files (assuming you used PB Modules):

-  `adminhtml/web/css/source/content-type/banner/_default.less`
-  `frontend/web/css/source/content-type/banner/_default.less`

 Use Page Builder's [CSS selector override pattern](../style/override-pagebuilder-styles.md) to target the `[data-element="content]` attribute in the DOM.

{: .bs-callout-info }
**Styling best practices:**
If you don't know [how Page Builder styles content](../style/introduction.md), you need to stop reading this topic, go read that topic, then come back and continue. Knowing how Page Builder styles its content (and yours) is an essential part of mastering appearances. When you know how Page Builder generates and applies its CSS to the DOM, you gain control over your Page Builder styling destiny. No more dreams of selector magic shattered by nightmares of !importance. You can finally win the specificity war (in Page Builder).

For example, the content type and `element` node we want to target are `banner` and `content`, as named in the config file. Page Builder adds these config nodes to the DOM as attributes (`data-* = "name"`). So all we need to do is start our selectors with `#html-body` followed by these two attributes:

```scss
#html-body [data-content-type='banner'] [data-element='content'] {
    overflow: scroll;
}
```

That's it. These selectors have a specificity of `120`, more than we need to override any styles Page Builder applies to the same DOM nodes. And we didn't even need to look at the DOM. We just needed to know how Page Builder styles its content.

The Less in our module's `_default.less` files looks like this:

```scss
// Targeting the DOM element in the Admin
#html-body [data-content-type='banner'] {
    [data-element='content'] {
        overflow: scroll;
    }
}

// Targeting the DOM element on the frontend
& when (@media-common = true) {
    #html-body [data-content-type='banner'] {
        [data-element='content'] {
            overflow: scroll;
        }
    }
}
```

### Testing your work

After adding your CSS/Less, run your Less transpiler, clean your cache (`bin/magento cache:clean`), drag a new Banner to the Admin stage, open the form editor, and take a look at your new field being rendered for every appearance in the form, similar to what's shown here:

![Appearance fieldset](../../images/appearance-fieldset.png){:width="934px" height="auto"}

## Summary

Before you begin any Page Builder development, first explore whether you can meet your customer's needs by extending existing content types. If you can, you should. It's a quicker path to completion and less work than creating a completely new content type.

With more experience, you may be surprised at how often you can adapt existing content types to meet your customer's needs.
